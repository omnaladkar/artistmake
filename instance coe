Function ARN: Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the Lambda function.

Memory/Timeout: Indicates how much memory is allocated to the function and its execution timeout limit.

Triggers: These are the AWS services or events that trigger the Lambda function. For example, an API Gateway, S3 bucket event, or DynamoDB stream.

Layers: Lambda layers allow you to add external dependencies and libraries to your function. You can reuse the layers in multiple Lambda functions.

Memory (128 MB to 10 GB): The amount of memory allocated to the Lambda function. The CPU allocated scales with the amount of memory.

Logs (CloudWatch): Lambda automatically integrates with Amazon CloudWatch to log information about the execution of your function, including performance metrics and error logs.

Metrics: CloudWatch metrics provide details such as the number of invocations, duration, error count, and success rate.
Alarms: You can configure CloudWatch Alarms to notify you when certain thresholds are breached (e.g., a high number of errors).
X-Ray Tracing: AWS X-Ray helps trace and analyze requests as they travel through your function and connected services. You can enable X-Ray tracing to troubleshoot performance bottlenecks
Reserved Concurrency: You can limit the number of simultaneous executions of your Lambda function by setting a reserved concurrency limit.
Provisioned Concurrency: Ensures that your Lambda function is initialized and ready to respond instantly when triggered, improving cold start performance.

Versions: AWS Lambda supports versioning, allowing you to publish different versions of your functionâ€™s code. This is useful for deploying updates while keeping the old versions intact.

Aliases: Aliases are like pointers to versions of your Lambda function. You can create an alias like "prod" or "test" that points to a specific version of your function.
